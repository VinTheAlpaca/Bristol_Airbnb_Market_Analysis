# Analysis of Bristol Airbnb Rental Data
### Project Objectives
Based on the Airbnb rental data of Bristol, this paper analyzed the local rental market. We managed to find out the gap of Bristol's rental market, forecast the changes of supply and demand in the market in the short term, and provide corresponding recommendations according to the analysis and prediction results.
### Project Description
The project is based on R and tableau.
1.	Using ARIMA model, this paper makes a time series analysis on the supply and demand changes of Bristol's rental market, and makes a 12-month forecast.
2.	Use tableau to explore the price differences in different regions and the supply and demand of different price houses.
3.	To investigate the supply and demand of different bed type houses and their demand changes from July 2018 to March 2020.
4.	Explore the factors that may affect the number of visits, and make quantitative analysis of the corresponding factors.
### Project Achievements
1.	We find the trend and seasonal change of Bristol's rental market (for example, it reaches the peak from June to August, starts to decline after October, and drops to the trough in February), and we find that it is highly correlated with British Tourism by collecting and comparing the tourism data provided by the British National Bureau of statistics. In addition, combined with the UK report on the impact of covid-19 on tourism, make a short-term forecast in the future.
2.	When exploring the impact of region and price on the rental market, it is found that there is still a large market gap in the high-end rental market in some regions (such as Filwood, St George Troopers Hill).
3.	In the comparison of different types of beds, it is found that the demand for air cushioned beds has increased significantly.
4.	In the test of influencing factors, it is found that the response rate and response speed of homeowners are the key factors affecting the number of visits. For those who can reply within one hour after inquiry, and the reply rate is 75% - 100%, the number of visits received is much higher than that of other houses.
5.	According to the analysis results and combined with the local actual situation, the corresponding recommendations are given, such as providing short-term cheap housing for exchange students in the low rental market and Erasmus project cooperation, developing high-end market in some areas, directional development of air cushion bed housing and setting up reward and punishment mechanism to improve the homeowner's response rate and response speed.
